# Description
This README provides an overview of how to analyze bipartite networks using the igraph library in R. The provided code demonstrates the creation of bipartite networks, projection to one-mode networks, and creating bipartite matrices from data frames. It's designed to help users understand, utilize, and extend the functionalities for their own analysis.

# Installation
To use the code in this project, ensure you have the igraph library installed: install.packages("igraph")
Then, include the library in your R script: library(igraph)

# Usage
1. An empty bipartite network is created using the graph.empty function.
2. Nodes are defined in nodelist1 and nodelist2.
3. Edges are defined in edge.list.
4. Vertices are added to the graph using add.vertices and edges using add.edges.
5. The bipartite network is visualized using colored shapes to represent different node types.

# One-Mode Projection
The script demonstrates the following steps for one-mode projection:
1. Calculate the incidence matrix using as_incidence_matrix.
2. Perform a bipartite projection using bipartite.projection.
3. Visualize the projected networks.
   
# Bipartite Matrix from DataFrame
The code showcases how to create a bipartite network using data stored in a data frame:
1. A data frame data_bipartite is defined with two columns: "Credit_cards" and "Customer_ID".
2. Nodes are extracted from unique values in the data frame columns.
3. Edges are created from the data frame using edges.list.
4. The bipartite network is constructed and visualized similarly to the previous example.

# Conclusion
The codes offer a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing the igraph library for analyzing bipartite networks. By following the provided code examples, users can create bipartite networks, project them to one-mode networks, and work with bipartite matrices. This information serves as a solid foundation for researchers, analysts, and developers looking to explore and analyze real-world bipartite relationships.
